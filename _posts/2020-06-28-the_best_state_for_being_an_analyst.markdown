If your job is being an analyst then the best state to live in is Alabama. I calculated this using the Bureau of Labor Statistic's Occupational Employment Survey data. I took the wage premium vs all the other jobs in the same state and Alabama had the highest wage premium. This means that assuming that each state has similar buying power for the people who are in the median that Alabama pays their analysts the highest multiple of the median wages of all the other jobs in the state. They pay nearly twice as much as the median salary which is 1.5x more than the bottom state; Arkansas. Alabama also has the highest earning gain from the 10th percentile ( analysts just starting out) to the median salary. This means that in Alabama they might not start out at the highest wages, but they do gain the most wage premium for their experience probably. That is my guess about why the wages are higher, but it could be just a unique job market for analysts where some are much lower level compared to the median, or it could be that they have much more complicated analyst jobs.
