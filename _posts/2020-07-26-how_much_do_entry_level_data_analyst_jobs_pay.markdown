I have searched online and I found 3 common and reputable websites to use. The sites that I found were Glassdoor,Indeed,and payscale. Glassdoor said average for data analyst to be $65,000 per year adjusted to Minneapolis averages, Indeed entry level data analyst salary was $59,000, and payscale was $60,000 per year for a data analyst. So roughly in my area since I live in a higher than average earning area I would predict that the average entry level is somewhere near $45,000- $60,000 per year. The average rent is $1600 per month in Minneapolis and I personally spend about $150 per month on food, cars on average cost about $700 per month, healthcare could cost $400 per month, and other could add up to another $400. If you take out a flat 20% for taxes I would net on average in the Minneapolis area
($50,000 * 0.80 = $40,000) - ($1600+$150+$700+$400+$400 = $3250 * 12 = $39,000) = $1000 per year to save roughly. That is not a lot and I could certainly spend less on cars, healthcare,and extras, but I do not believe that this number would be the average amount if I were to spend less. The entry level data analyst salary is good if you were to buy the cheaper end products, but if you were to spend the median amounts then there would not be a lot of savings.
