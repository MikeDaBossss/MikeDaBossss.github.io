According to a survey from the Federal Reserve in 2016 the median amount of wealth if you were my age 25-29 is $9000 with including home equity and $4400 without home equity. Wealth is calculated as total assets minus total debts. This is not very much at all I would say considering that the median income for adults is $65,000 for 25-34 year olds. I believe that this is because most people have student loan debt, car loan debt, credit card debt, and other debts. Even though student loans are only around $25,000 once graduating from college and cars only cost a fraction of what car owners have to pay because of the value that they still have I believe that these things end up bringing down total assets. I could not find the personal savings rate calculated by age group but I saw figures from 12% to 30%. Meaning that each year making $65,000 a person could save $7800 to $20,000 per year which would be a lot more than the median amount that I am finding from the Federal Reserve survey. It would be nice if a government group would be able to get data from all sorts of banking institutions to be able to tabulate how much wealth people actually have instead of relying on a survey which could be unreliable because of biases.
