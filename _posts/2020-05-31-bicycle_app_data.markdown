I was using a free bicycle tracking iphone application today to track the speed,distance,and time of my bike rides. It also gives me a history, calories, and it tells me where I went on the bike ride. I was thinking that the bike app owner could use the data to help the government make better decisions. Recently where I live there is a new bike path that had to have cost tens of thousands of dollars to build but it is completely pointless as there is already a bike path 500 feet away. If only the city that I live in had been using the data from these apps that track exactly where people go they could understand better if it is worth it or not. For example they could see when, where, how often, and maybe even how long it takes to cross the street. These data points would be exactly what the app owners should sell to municipalities in order to be more efficient with tax payer dollars. This is how the app can remain free and at the same time how it can make money.
