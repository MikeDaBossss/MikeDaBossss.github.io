I was lead to believe that artificial intelligence is some type of untouchable only for ultra intelligent people type of tool. This is not very accurate and I recently realized this when I was watching a video on how to teach a computer to play an atari game. Reinforcement learning is a way to let a computer learn how to play a game or interact in a system without having to tell it how to do it but by instead programming what the positive and negative rewards are. This is not the most complicated thing to do, but it is very good at learning. I saw that reinforcement learning could learn complex tasks without any explanation in a relatively short amount of time and that it is much more simple than trying to hard code. This is the way that self driving technology works and it is a way that Google has used to beat the top chess players in the world all without having to tell the computer how to win but by letting it learn from its mistakes and successes.
