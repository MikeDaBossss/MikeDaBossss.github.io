I read that Apple just became the first company to have a $2 trillion market cap or stock market net worth. So I was wondering because I have some accounting experience and data experience why Apple was worth so much. I looked at some basic financials from Apple and I ended puzzled at how the company is worth $2 trillion. Their net assets are only $90 billion and they make only $50 billion per year with relatively small growth revenue wise from year to year of 7%. If I had $2 trillion in a loan from a lender paying a good rate of 3% I would have to make payments of $60 billion just to pay off the interest without paying off any principal. Every year I would lose billions just trying to make a very tiny dent in the loan. Eventually if revenue and profits kept getting larger it would be possible to pay off the loan very slowly, but this investment would return a very small net return or I imagine there could be better investments. If I was on a 30 year loan I would be paying $100 billion per year in payments. It would take 10 years before being able to have $100 billion in profits per year roughly and by then there would be an accumulation of hundreds of billions more in losses.
