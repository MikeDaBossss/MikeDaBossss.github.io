I am seeing all the political ads and feeling like the election season is here now so I have been wondering who is going to win the presidency? I looked at some of the sports betting odds on the presidental election and I found that Joe Biden is winning nearly 2 to 1 against Donald Trump. The averages are about 60% Joe Biden and 35% Donald Trump. I know that the sports book makers are good at making the odds from past experience or else they would lose a lot of money so since I found this trend on 7 different betting sites I believe that as of today Joe Biden is winning by a large margin. Joe Biden overtook Donald Trump around 2 months ago and he has been increasing his lead for two months in a row. Donald Trump will need to do something very strong to reverse this trend in time which is only 3 months away. This should be interesting to see what the Trump administration will have to do in order to reverse the lead that Joe Biden has.
