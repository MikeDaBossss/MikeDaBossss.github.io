I saw on LinkedIn a post about how a company has figured out or is near figuring out how to make robots that can farm raspberries. This was a big success because raspberries are very soft so they are hard for robots to pick without ruining them. This means that robot ran farms are close to being a real life product. I saw on a quick google search that they already have had large industrial picking machines for a while now, but they apparently are not used at every farm. I read that instead of costing $5 per crate the machine only costs $.25 per crate. This makes it obvious that farmers should have machines pick the blueberries because it costs 20x less than having people do it. It is so much cheaper and quicker that I do not understand why farms have not switched to the machine version. This is how great automation can be and a good visualization of just how much better technology can make certain tasks.
