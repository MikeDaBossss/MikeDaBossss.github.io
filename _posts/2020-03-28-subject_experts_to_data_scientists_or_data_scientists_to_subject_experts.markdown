There are a lot of times where in order to do a data science project there has to be an understanding of the subject that the data is in. One example could be understanding the amount of pay Chief Executives make at the 75th and 90th percentiles if you know the 10th,25th, and the median. There could be a few ways to figure out what those percentiles are that I have been able to think of. The easiest way is to take a ratio of other jobs and figure out their ratios of different percentiles and then plug it in with the current data. I did not want to do this way because I know that Chief Executives have a large difference in the amount of pay because they work for different size companies and each company might make a different amount of money making the pay ranges a lot different than usual. I happened to know this because of personal experiences in my life, but I would have a hard time figuring this out just from looking at the data that was given to me. 

So when this happened I was wondering if it would be harder in this instance for a jobs and compensation expert to become a data scientist and learn the math or for a data scientist to learn the jobs and compensation side? I think that it is easier to learn how to do the math and computer section instead of the jobs and compensation side. In order to learn the math you could simply think about a few other data science projects, learn the basics of math, and learn some neural network basics. This would be the quickest way to get good results without having to have a PhD in math. In order to learn the jobs and compensation you would have to read all the industries inside and out and figure out how the pay works in each one. This would take a lot more time because each industry has lots and lots of things that affect the pay of a given person and each little difference can be a huge difference in the total amount of pay. 

Data science is a hard topic to get really good at such as poker, but becoming an expert in a certain field takes a long time to get any type of result where as with data science it is possible to get good results without such a large amount of training.
